# Foundational Linux Skills

Much of the software you'll be using will be running on Linux so it's important to learn how to it. If you've never used Linux before, that's not a problem! A lot of what you'll encounter will feel familiar if you've used Windows or macOS before. 

There's often this misconception that you need to know how to code in order to use Linux. While it's handy to know in certain situations, it's not required and many things can be accomplish through the graphical user interface ([GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)).

As an added bonus, if you'll looking to transfer to Portland State University and/or taking CS161B, this guide will help you reinforce the information you may have learned in class and prepare you for using Linux at PSU. 

Feel free to skip around the guide if you and your team are already familar with some of the operations below.

## Navigating Around

### GUI

Like many of the operating systems you may have used before, many programs can be accessed by clicking on the ... button in the top left corner of the screen, similar to the Start button on many versions of Windows. 

One of these programs is the file manager seen below:

The file manager program for Linux is very similar to the File Manager in Windows or the Finder in macOS. You can organize your files using this program. 

Another program is ...

### Command Line

In some situations, such as running the code that controls your robot, you'll need access to the command line. It's best to think of the command line as typing out what you want the computer to do as opposed to clicking and/or dragging things like you would normally do. 

For example, if you wanted to move one folder (also called a directory) to another one, you might click and drag it into its destination. Using the command line, you could accomplish the same thing by typing:

> mv folder_you_want_to_move folder_you_want_to_move_it_to

So what are the benefits of using using the command line versus using the GUI? In come cases, it's much faster. While the previous example may look like there's a lot to type, it can be sped up by using the `TAB` key on your keyboard.
