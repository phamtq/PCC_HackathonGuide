# Brainstorming
In this section of the guide you find different ways to organize your team and strategies for coming up with ideas for your project.

## Roles
It's important that you work together with **EVERY** member of your team to accomplish your goals. Not every job has to be technical and those that aren't, are just as vital to the success of your team. Multiple people can work on one task (that task can usually be divided into smaller subtasks). Below are *some* of the jobs in your team that may help you do better and they not all strictly programming roles:

+ *Project Manager* - They ensure that tasks get accomplished in the limited amount of time you have and work with other teammates to figure out who will do specific parts of the project. They also ensure that the different parts of the project work together. Nothing's more frustrating than putting in all that work just to see that you don't have any resembling a cohesive project. 

+ *Technical Writer* - They're in charge of the documentation. Any project of sufficient size will need to explain certain aspect of the program to other members of the team. Sure, someone might not be working on "feature X" but they need a general overview of what that feature does so that it's not incompatible with what they're doing. A lot of changes often occur while making a program and often the documentation is not updated. 

+ *UX / UI Designer* - If your project's demo or mock-up would work better as a web dashboard, this might be the role for you. You can help your team design an interface that makes the robot easier to use so the folks listening to you presentation can better understand the benefits of your project.

+ *Hardware engineer* - Your role doesn't have to be just writing code. It could be building a helpful sensor using the electronics parts available in the lab. All the robots have a single-board computer, like the Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano, and have [GPIO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output) access.

## Coming up with ideas
One of the best ways for idea generation is to ask yourself, "What are some of the problems affecting me and the people I know?". While you're likely not going to have a complete solution by the end of the hackathon, you'll have finished the most difficult step, getting started. Even focusing on one small component of the complete solution is enough.

Or you could do something weird and silly like a robot that learns where your hand is so that it can give you high-fives. Or using computer vision to randomly pick up a snack and drop it in your hand. Why? Because sometimes you have too many snack options and need someone (or something) to do it for you. 

Regardless of what angle you want to approach this, gather all your teammates around a table or at the couches. Have everyone spend a few minutes jotting down what ever ideas comes to mind. Feel free to use LLM like ChatGPT or Google Gemini to help generate ideas. Take those ideas to the whiteboard and diagram it out.

Work with your teammates to figure out which of those ideas can be accomplished within the timeframe given for the event.
