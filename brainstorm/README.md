## Roles
It's important that you work together with **EVERY** member of your team to accomplish your goals. Not every job has to be technical and those that aren't, are just as vital to the success of your team. Multiple people can work on one task (that task can usually be divided into smaller subtasks). Below are *some* of the jobs in your team that may help you do better. And they aren't even programming roles:

+ *Project Manager* - They ensure that tasks get accomplished in the limited amount of time you have and work with other teammates to figure out who will do specific parts of the project. They also ensure that the different parts of the project work together. Nothing's more frustrating than putting in all that work just to see that you don't have any resembling a cohesive project. 

+ *Technical Writer* - They're in charge of the documentation. Any project of sufficient size will need to explain certain aspect of the program to other members of the team. Sure, someone might not be working on "feature X" but they need a general overview of what that feature does so that it's not incompatible with what they're doing. A lot of changes often occur while making a program and often the documentation is not updated.
