# Tools for Collaboration

Ideas are a dime a dozen. Everyone has them, but not everyone has the ability to bring them to life. And you certainly won't be able to do it on your own. In addition to there not being enough robotic equipment for everyone to work by themselves, you just don't have enough time. You're going to feel tired and frustrated and that time you spend recovering can be made more useful by letting other people work on other parts of the project.

So to increase your chances of bringing that project to fruition, you're going to need some tools to organize everything and keep everyone on the same page. Many of these tools are used as part of professional projects in jobs you'll encounter when you graduate.

## Project Management Software
You can use everything from a simple shared TODO list like [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com), or ones specifically designed for larger projects like:
+ [Trello](https://trello.com/)
+ [Notion](https://www.notion.com/)
+ [Asana](https://asana.com). 

They are all free or have a trial period that will work for your 1 day project. 

If you're unfamilar with any of these tools, I suggest writing the tasks down on paper and then transfering it later to these pieces of software as you get more familar with it. 

## Communication Tools
While you're going to be next to each other working on this project, some of you might want to work away from the group in a quiter spot. Having a way to communicate with each other will help you stay in the loop while letting you get things done. It's also a good way to transfer small files to each other like a PDF of something you found.

You can use things like [Discord](https://discord.com/), [Slack](https://slack.com/), or even starting a group chat over iMessage, Android Messages, or What'sApp.
