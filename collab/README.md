# Tools for Collaboration

Ideas are a dime a dozen. Everyone has them, but not everyone has the ability to bring them to life. And you certainly won't be able to do it on your own. In addition to there not being enough robotic equipment for everyone to work by themselves, you just don't have enough time. You're going to feel tired and frustrated and that time you spend recovering can be made more useful by letting other people work on other parts of the project.

So to increase your chances of bringing that project to fruition, you're going to need some tools to organize everything and keep everyone on the same page. Many of these tools are used as part of professional projects in jobs you'll encounter when you graduate.
